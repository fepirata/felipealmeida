        <h2>Framework Overview, Prototype Idea</h2>
        <h3>What is React.js?</h3>
        <p>React.js is a library focused in create interfaces based on components. The main idea is that we can create components for each part of the website. These components may be bigger than others and may use smaller components inside. Although, the main structure of React.js is: components.</p>

        <p>Other important point about React.js, is because these components can be reusable in other parts of the website, this way, you don’t need to code again the whole page if it uses the same structure. Also, depending the way the components are created, they can be used in “smart ways”, so It can be reusable for different purposes.</p>

        <p>The name “React” itself give us a hint about one of its potentials: React.js can reacts to different states. With that functionality the component can be written with the methods to react to specific segments inside the component. It creates a very organized and controlled structure.</p>


        <h3>Why React.js?</h3>

        <p>React.js it’s a library to create UI that’s is in ascension since 2014, the number of websites and products that’re based in React.js keeps increasing, as well as the number of job offers. </p>

        <p>It’s important to mention that I don’t have a background in programming, and the language that I have more knowledge is JavaScript. Based on my research, React.js is not a hard library to learn, once its API is very short to learn.</p>

        <p>These couple reasons make me choose to learn React.js for this term.</p>

        <h3>How it works?</h3>

        <p>One of the (great) points of React.js is how it works. React.js creates a Virtual DOM, that way we don’t need to manipulate the changes directly in the DOM, but just in the Virtual DOM. Then, the React.js algorithms runs to make the comparison through differentiation, and just replace what was actually changed, instead of create a complete new DOM. I will explain in a few steps how it works:
        </p>

        <ul class="section-ul">
            <li>Event triggered is sent to the application;</li>
            <li>React.js creates a Virtual DOM for before and a Virtual DOM for after;</li>
            <li>It compares these two DOMs and Patch the instructions to the Browser DOM;</li>
            <li>The Browser DOM is changed just in the specific part requested.</li>
        </ul>

        <img src="asset01.png" alt="" class="section-content">

        <h3>Prototype Idea</h3>

        <p>I would like to create a simple system that can help me to understand the structure to create a web application. Therefore, I will create simple components to build main sections of a website: Header, Content and Footer. For each one of them, I will create a component. Also, I will create two additional content pages, to change them inside the page using buttons. In addition to that I want to add a textbox to change dynamically the text inside the content. </p>

        <img src="asset02.png" alt="" class="section-content">

        <p>Throughout this process I can understand the basics of how to work with React.js and learn with the mistakes and some struggles during the process.</p>

        <h2>Prototype User Stories</h2>
        <p>As I mentioned above, my prototype consist in a simple usage of components to understand the main funcionality of the React.js library. Because of that, the main public of my prototype is myself, as an student. Therefore, I am using myself, as a student, to create the User Stories, and the main outcome is to learn the library </p>

        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <img src="asset03.jpg" alt="" class="section-content">

        <p>Using the outcomes from the User Stories I can guide my study for the prototype, and compare if I could reach all the points I wanted in the User Stories.</p>

        <h2>Progress Report</h2>
        <h3>Retrospective</h3>
        <p>In the previous weeks I could understand a bit more how to React.js works. I could create a little tutorial project that helped me to  understand the main structure of this library. There're some points I went through during the last week:</p>

        <ul class="section-ul">
            <li>Creating components for each part that would be used in the page.</li>
            <li>Creating State variables that could be changed or pulled to the component.</li>
            <li>Using methods to change the state of some elements inside the component.</li>
            <li>Using props to work with pareting relation between components.</li>
            <li>Using props to work with pareting relation between components</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>Kanban Backlog</h3>
        <img src="asset04.png" alt="" class="section-content">

        <p>In addition to that, I could start to create the main prototype based on my idea. I created the main project, as well as its components.</p>
        <p>Overall I'm late based on my schedule. I needed to use some of my project time to other tasks. Because of that, I'm changing some of my tasks for other subjects to another week, so I will have enough time to finish the prototype in time.</p>

        <h2>Final Prototype</h2>
        <a href="https://glacial-tundra-39141.herokuapp.com/">Live Prototype  -ReactJS</a>
        <p>Above you have access to my first prototype based on ReactJS. Work with that was great experience. ReactJS give me a lot o control over each detail in my website. I'm excited (and a little bit afraid) to go to the next step and mix my fresh new knowledge on ReactJS with the group project.</p>

        <h2>Group Project - Rental Moose</h2>
        <h3>Brief Explanation about this project</h3>
        <p>Now that I know the basics of ReactJS, I am able to focus a bit more on the Term 3 Project. Since a never mention about this project in my blog, I'll give a brief explanation below.</p>

        <p>Essentially, it's a platform where tenants could create their rental resumes
            to apply for listed properties. With this knowledge in hands, our system's
            algorithms generate a Tenant Risk Score that's provided to landlords and real
            estate agencies, where they can easily screen through many applications for a
            particular property, using data visualization features. They also can actively seek
            potential tenants in our database, using valuable criteria such as neighborhoods
            of interest, maximum budget, overall tenant risk score or even more detailed and
            customized risk assessments, for example, property damage risk.</p>

            <h3>User Stories</h3>
            <img src="asset05.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>First step, work with the user stories! Starting from this step, I can have a really good idea about what is important and what should be focused in our web application, so I can plan the user experience through the pages, as well as the structure of the site. I believe I still need to go deeper in some points of the user stories, but for a first structure, it is already useful</p>

            <h2>20% Progress Report</h2>
            <img src="asset06.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>The first of the reports related to the final group project. This time my progress was very short since I am the main responsible for all the visual design in our project. I've been worked in the Wireframes for the webapp (That I'm glad to annnounce it's completed!). I've also created the visual basic elements for our project, like logo, color scheme, main and support fonts, as well the mockups and the UI Kit.</p>
            <p>Ok, but what about ReactJS? Yes, I know. I decided to finish this part of the process to concentrated both classes (Directed Studies and Project II), just working on ReactJS, but unfortunately, to do that, these UI and UX processes needed to be finished as soon as possible.</p>
            <p>Because of that even my cards are short and not so detailed. I'm sure that after the Components Architecture the number of cards will be at least 4x more. But for now, I need to focus on finish the UI/UX process. So after that, me and ReactJS can meet again for a big journey into this project.</p>

            <h2>40% Progress Report</h2>
            <img src="asset07.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>The second report related to the final project. Time to organize which components will be created. I was responsible to create the initial React project as well as the components architecture. I've made a search in different ReactJS structure on the internet, specificaly in these links:</p>
            <ul class="section-ul">
                <li><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/faq-structure.html">React JS - File Structure </a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/react-architecture-best-practices">Sitepoint - 5 React Architecture Best Practices</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://medium.com/@alexmngn/how-to-better-organize-your-react-applications-2fd3ea1920f1">Medium - How to better organize your React applications?</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://hackernoon.com/structuring-projects-and-naming-components-in-react-1261b6e18d76">Hackernoon - Structuring projects and naming components in React</a></li>

            </ul>
            <p>It helped me to understand how to organize and choose a good strategy for our group</p>
            <p>Three members from the group will be responsible to create the react components. We going to use SASS as well, the .jsx file and the scss file will be stored in the same folder, the component and its style can be changed in the same folder.</p>
            <p>We are aware that some changes in the structure can be made since this is our first bigger structure in ReactJS.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <hr>
            <h2>60% and 80% Progress Report</h2>
            <p>We are heading the end of the project. Since I was responsible for helping the other members to understand the structure, I had just a few progress on my 60% progress report. Because of that, I've decided to move to this report, and add everything I did since that.</p>

            <h3>Implementing the basic structure</h3>
            <img src="asset08.png" alt="" class="section-content">

            <p>Four members from our group are working on the ReactJS project part. Because of that, I needed to work in a way that everybody could work together. So the first point was to organize the .jsx and .scss projects. The basic rules is: Create a component and add the .scss file inside the same folder. This way we don't need to search for the right component style or vice versa.</p>

            <h3>Working on the basic components: Nav</h3>
            <img src="asset09.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>We have different Navs, so we need to create different versions for that. I'm not the best one programming and the lack of time since I am the main designer in our group decrease even more my programming time. So what I decided to do was to use a "if - else", and pass the argument to the parent. So the parent can decide which page will load.</p>
            <p>This version pass through several versions. I've started just adding the if else in the same component, and then, I decided to create seperate components for each version, so it's more organized and I have more control if I want to change something.</p>
            <p>Also, another point here, is that in the internal page, we have the name of the user logged. We are not sure if we going to create the login process, due to the lack of time. But I decided to pass a variable instead of just write the name normally.</p>

            <h3>Working on the basic components: Header</h3>
            <img src="asset10.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>The Header follows the same process, but this time we have 3 different Headers, so I created props names to be given to the parent. Depdending the props name "FrontPage", "LandlordPage", "TenantPage", I have different outputs. </p>
            <img src="asset11.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>That's a simple output as an example of the front page. Here I decided which version of the Header and Nav I'll use.</p>

            <h3>Working on the basic components: Buttons</h3>
            <img src="asset12.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>I also created the basic buttons, the structure is quite simple, but it creates more organization, since when you need to add buttons you just need to use the component.</p>
            <img src="asset13.png" alt="" class="section-content">
            <p>That's is the output for the main button.</p>

            <h3>Additional points I'm working on</h3>
            <ul class="section-ul">
                <li>Front Page</li>
                <li>Main Page Landlord</li>
                <li>Main Page Tenant</li>
                <li>Card Component</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>90% Progress Report</h2>
            <img src="asset14.png" alt="" class="section-content">

            <h3>This week I was working in a lot o small adjustments in several parts. I’ve worked adjusting almost all the components:</h3>
            <ul class="section-ul">
                <li>CSS adjustments in all pages</li>
                <li>Adjusting and adding props to be changed by the parent component on Nav, Header, Cards, FrontPage, Landlord Page, Tenant Page</li>
                <li>The Footer component was created.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What worked well?</h3>
            <p>Since the structure is well organized: fix components/css relatively simple. Some adjustments take time, but it would take even more time if the structure was not well organized.</p>
            <p>Working together is not an issue: we are essentially in two working on the components, and this week I needed to create some additional components for the project related to the Web Application promotion. Because of that, Alex helped me in some unfinished adjusts, and he didn’t have problems to finish my component.</p>

            <h3>What needs to be improved?</h3>
            <p>I think I didn’t have enough time this week, I’m not sure if it was bad personal organization or additional requests from the design part to the project. But  since it didn’t affect the evolution of the project I’m not concern.</p>

            <h3>What was interesting?</h3>
            <p>Honestly, this week there was not some interesting point.</p>

            <h3>What I would do different?</h3>
            <p>Now that we are heading the end of the project I miss a bit I didn’t learn Redux. I’ve shared some of my issues related to organize the props and Maggie told me that Redux could help exactly in what I need. I’ve started to learn, but I’m not sure if we going to implement in the project.
            </p>

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Now it’s time to fix and create the remaining components if is necessary. Based on my component structure we have all the components. But to make it work with the backend, I think we need to change some points. I cannot be precise because we are going to discuss about that in a few days. But overall, I’m really confident about the next week.</p>

            <h2>Final Check-in, Retrospective</h2>

            <img src="asset15.png" alt="" class="section-content">

            <p>This is my final post on this portfolio page. It was definitely a great journey learning ReactJS. I started with a simple project, but through that project I could understand the fundamental behaviour to work with ReactJS, it was way easier to jump to my final project after started this first one.</p>

            <p>You can check out our live project here: <a href="https://gracious-ptolemy-5df78f.netlify.com/">In our Live Prototype</a>, or here: <a href="https://www.therentalmoose.com/">In our deployed version</a>. There are two links because in our live prototype we give access to internal pages without sign in.</p>


            <h3>What worked Well & what was interesting?</h3>

            <p>During the final project itself I could learn even more than just React. The first part of the process, working with the Component Architecture, was really important, I needed to think that we’ll create dozens of components, not just a couple ones like in my previous project. Also, I needed to pay attention about how they are organized, how I going to named them, because I’m not working alone this time. Looking back to this step makes me proud that worked. I’m totally sure that it could be even better than that, but it was a great beginning for my first ReactJS project.</p>
            <p>Working with ReactJS was marvellous. I personally like the part of the process when we can wrap content and reuse that again in something else, maybe it’s because of my Design background, but create a template and use it again gives me a personal enjoyment. Also, give a component the ability to be smart, react to something that happened is even better. </p>
            <p>The learning process was faster in the beginning, but throughout the weeks, it was getting harder, not just because the schedule was getting tighter, but also my doubts with React were going to a new level of difficulty. Every time I needed to understand a concept and how to apply it, it took me hours until I fully understood. I decided to only apply a thinking process I understood, so I increased a bit the time to implement a process.</p>

            <h3>What needs to be improved & what I would do different?</h3>
            <p>One important thing that I probably going to do is learning Redux, organizing the properties in a way that I can easily have control over them is essential, I miss that, in our actual project, I also miss I didn’t learned that. Because of that I’m already studying and I definitely will keep studying to apply in my next project.</p>

            <h3>Final thoughts and next steps</h3>

            <p>Overall, I had a great experience learning ReactJS in directed Studies, I’m aware I just scratched the surface, I can do even more with React, and I definitely will. But for now, I’m glad I could successfully finish this project, and I’m ready to start a new project. I’m aware that keep learning is a mix of frustration in the beginning and joy went we finally learned, I’m always afraid wen’t I start, but look back and see what I accomplished make me wanted to do it again, and that’s what I’m going to do, keep learning. </p>

            <p>So long, and thanks for all the fish (Douglas Adams, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)</p>
